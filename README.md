# Restoring a Completely Bricked Redmi Note 9

## A Step-by-Step Guide

This guide outlines the process of fixing a hard-bricked Redmi Note 9 (merlin) and restoring it to its original working condition. A hard-bricked device is one that is stuck in an infinite boot loop displaying only the Redmi logo, with no access to recovery, fastboot, or the ability to connect to a computer. By following these steps, you can resolve this issue without the need for professional service.

Please note that following this guide will result in the complete erasure of your device, including any custom recovery or ROM. The bootloader will also be locked again. Make sure to follow the steps carefully to ensure a successful restoration.

## Requirements

- Python (3.9.7 or the latest version)
- Official Xiaomi fastboot image for Redmi Note 9
- Zip file containing MTK Drivers, SP Flash Tool, and additional scripts
- USB cable
- Windows 10 (this guide assumes Windows operating system)

## Step 1: Prepare the Required Files

1. Download Python from the official website and install it. During installation, select the "Add Python to PATH" option. Verify the installation by opening Command Prompt and typing `python` or `py`. This should display the Python version.
2. Download the official Xiaomi fastboot image for Redmi Note 9 from [here](https://www.miui.com/download.html). Choose the appropriate version and download the "Full ROM" file (e.g., "merlin_images....tgz").
3. Download the zip file containing MTK Drivers, SP Flash Tool, and additional scripts from [this Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aSQ58gKY93bpcclFCxndSpKeE3pnE3qm/view?usp=sharing).

## Step 2: Battery Drain

Allow the phone's battery to completely drain to end the boot looping. This step helps prevent errors during the restoration process.

## Step 3: Install MTK Drivers

1. Extract the downloaded zip file containing MTK Drivers.
2. Enter the "MTK Driver" folder and run "MTK_Driver_Auto_Installer_SP_Drivers_20160804.exe" to install the MTK Driver.
3. Reboot your computer after driver installation.

## Step 4: Install USB Drivers and Libraries

1. Extract the downloaded zip file and locate the "libusb" folder.
2. Run "libusb-win32-devel-filter-1.2.6.0.exe" and follow the installation prompts.
3. When prompted, launch the "Filter Installer Wizard." Select "Install a device filter" and choose your connected USB devices, including your Redmi Note 9.
